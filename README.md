##Mission Statement

UniClick provides an affordable interfacial software platform between professors and students in a classroom environment to ensure a new and profound experience is created in the realm of academia. As a mobile clicker application for education, it enhances the experiences of both the professor and student with features that focus on behavioral assessment, performance evaluation and attendance tracking. 

The UniClick team is not just committed to satisfying the education needs of an institution, but redefining the way professors interact with students and how students learn inside of the classroom. The UniClick team is interested in clicker technology because currently, Stevens Institute of Technology mandates all incoming students to purchase bulky, ineffective, expensive clickers that lack functionality and use. To address this concern, the team has taken it upon themselves to research and develop alternative solution to these outdated, underutilized clicker systems and costly third-party subscription-based clicker software.


Through the agile software development process, the UniClick team will accomplish their goal of fusing helpful learning tools with unique features on to a mobile operating platform. By incorporating built-in data analytics features, UniClick provides professors with a method to track thought processes, learning patterns and understanding of concepts related to subject-matter, thus catering to the academic needs of individuals in the classroom. UniClick enriches each classroom experience at a university in an interactive way so to improve the quality of higher education around the world. The UniClick team has researched the wide use, applications and features of clicker technology that exist in todayâ€™s education sector and now, they are committed to delivering an application of their own that incorporates three fundamentally unique features: a question creator, attendance tracker and metric analyzer.
