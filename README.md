##Mission Statement

UniClick provides an affordable interfacial software platform between professors and students in a classroom environment to ensure a new and profound experience is created in the realm of academia. As a mobile clicker application for education, it enhances the experiences of both the professor and student with features that focus on behavioral assessment, performance evaluation and attendance tracking. 

The UniClick team is not just committed to satisfying the education needs of an institution, but redefining the way professors interact with students and how students learn inside of the classroom. The UniClick team is interested in clicker technology because currently, Stevens Institute of Technology mandates all incoming students to purchase bulky, ineffective, expensive clickers that lack functionality and use. To address this concern, the team has taken it upon themselves to research and develop alternative solution to these outdated, underutilized clicker systems and costly third-party subscription-based clicker software.
